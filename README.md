# ``BbAppAuthorSchema``

Data structures for representing authors in the BbApp ecosystem.

## Overview

The BbAppAuthorSchema library provides foundational data structures for author information, including registered users and anonymous contributors. It defines ``BbAppAuthorData`` for authenticated authors with unique identifiers and optional profile information, and ``BbAppContentGuestAuthorData`` for guest authors. The module also includes utility functions for converting between author types and generating guest email addresses based on guest IDs.
